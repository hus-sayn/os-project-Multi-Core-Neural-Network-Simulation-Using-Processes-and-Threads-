# os-project-Multi-Core-Neural-Network-Simulation-Using-Processes-and-Threads-
This project aims to simulate a neural network architecture on a multi-core processor by leveraging operating system-level constructs such as processes and threads. Each layer of the neural network is implemented as a separate process, while individual neurons within a layer are represented as threads.
